# animator-board
SVG Animator


I started working on this project as POC but it came out pretty well as per my expectation. User can then export the generated code & use it in his own project.
Hosting this on github so you guys can also use & try this. It will be helpful if you guys can share your suggestions. 

Pull requests are also welcome.


Hope you guys will like it
